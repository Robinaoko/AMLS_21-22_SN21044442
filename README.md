# How to use
The code contains both binary classification and multi-classification implementations of tumour images.

# Binary Classification Task
The code is mainly written in jupyter-notebook.  
Just open jupyter-notebook to run these four codes directly, and each specific function can be clearly seen in the file.  
CNN-Classificaiton uses a simple neural network for binary classification.    
KNN-Classificaiton uses the K-nearest neighbor algorithm for binary classification.    
Logistic-Regression uses the logistic regression algorithm for binary classification.    
SVM-Classificaiton uses the SVM for binary classification.  






 

# Multi-Classificaiton Task


# Library: 
matplotlib               3.4.2  
numpy                    1.19.5
